  ! --- RESISTIVITY SWITCHES FOR AR AND AZ EQUATIONS
  ! --- 1.
  ! --- Default set-up is eta_ARAZ_on = .true.
  ! --- In this case, the same resistivity is used for all AR,AZ,A3 components
  ! --- 2.
  ! --- If (eta_ARAZ_on = .true.) and (eta_ARAZ_simple = .true.), then the Fprof component of Bphi is removed from the resistive term.
  ! --- Note that in a stationary equilibrium, the Fprof component of Bphi from the current and the current source should exactly cancel anyway.
  ! --- However, this Fprof component can lead to strong noise at high resistivity, so it is often better to remove it.
  ! --- 3.
  ! --- If (eta_ARAZ_on = .false.), then resistivity is switched off by default for the AR and AZ equations.
  ! --- However, regardless of which eta-model is used for A3, (ie. eta_T_dependent or not), you can still set eta_ARAZ_const 
  ! --- which will use a constant resistivity at the level eta_ARAZ_const.
  ! --- 4.
  ! --- Here again, setting (eta_ARAZ_simple = .true.) with eta_ARAZ_const removes the Fprof dependence of Bphi in the resistive term and the current term for AR&AZ
